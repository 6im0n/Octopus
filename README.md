> [!CAUTION]
> Docker, Podman, other containerization technologies, and Ansible Galaxy are strictly for-
bidden for this project.
You may however use the Community namespace’s collections.


> [!NOTE]
> Security cannot be ignored when working in a DevOps environment.
As such, any clear-text password found in your repository will cause the evaluation
to stop right away, and the entire project will be considered as failed.
You have been warned.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Avoid using the command / shell / raw modules as much as possible.
Have a look at dedicated and cleaner modules instead, such as apt_key, apt_repository, or pip.
Use the command module only if no dedicated module exists.
